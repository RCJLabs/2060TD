# LAST LINE — Roadmap

Milestones are scoped as focused build-sessions, not calendar time. Each milestone ends in a
committed, runnable state. Versions: v0.1 is the first shareable build (M3).

---

## M0 — Foundation ✅ *(this session)*

Prove the riskiest mechanic (weighted maze pathfinding) inside a deterministic sim, with docs
and tooling in place.

- [x] Design docs: `GDD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`
- [x] Scaffold: Vite + TypeScript (strict) + Phaser 3 + Vitest + ESLint, README
- [x] Sim core: fixed-tick engine (20 tps), seeded PRNG, grid with wall HP, command queue
- [x] Weighted A*: wall traversal cost = `wallHP / unitWallDPS`; around-vs-through behavior
- [x] Runners (walker + breacher profiles), turret (deterministic targeting), HQ leak counting
- [x] Tests: PRNG, pathfinding behavior, engine behavior, determinism state-hash
- [x] Maze playground scene: paint/erase walls, place turrets, spawn runners, live path
      visualization, HUD, sim speed toggle, `?demo=1` scripted setup
- [x] Verified: `npm test`, `npm run build`, Playwright screenshot

## M1 — Siege vertical slice ✅

The active TD battle became a real game: **HOLD THE LINE**, five authored waves at the
Coos Bay perimeter.

- [x] Wave system: authored wave definitions (composition, spacing, entry rows), inbound
      wave preview in the INTEL panel during setup/prep
- [x] Command Point economy: passive + per-kill income, phase-gated costs (Supplies for
      the permanent layer, CP for field defenses/powers), repair-all pricing
- [x] 4 USA field defenses: deployable MG, rifle foxhole, claymore field, HESCO barricade
- [x] 3 USA emplacements: M2 nest, 25mm autocannon, 120mm mortar (splash, min range,
      target-leading lobbed shells)
- [x] 6 China attacker types: militia, rifle squad, sapper, grenadier (stands off and
      shells defenses), ZBD IFV, Type 99 — plus demolition of *any* blocking structure
      (gun lines are obstacles with HP, not hard walls)
- [x] Damage-type × armor-class combat table; hitscan weapons + deterministic mortar
      projectiles
- [x] Command Center entity (2×2, perimeter assault), win/lose flow, between-wave prep
      window with repair and re-mazing
- [x] Battle HUD: CP bar, phase banner, build palettes per phase, power buttons with
      cooldowns, INTEL/SITREP blocks, victory/defeat overlay
- [x] Render polish: interpolation, per-damage-type tracers, shells in flight, AoE rings,
      strafe fx, ghost previews with range rings, power target previews

Carried to M2: unspent-CP → salvage conversion on victory (needs the persistent town
economy to matter), weapon line-of-sight rules (decide vs keep lob-over-walls), hit-flash
on damaged targets.

## M2 — Town & economy ✅

The persistent base between battles: the game is now a loop, not a mission.

- [x] Carried from M1: unspent-CP → salvage Supplies on victory (2:1); impact hit
      flashes; line-of-sight **decided**: no LoS checks — mortars/grenades lob, direct
      fire is abstracted (revisit only if playtests demand it)
- [x] TownScene build mode: place/move buildings (rotate dropped — square footprints,
      no facing), wall drag-painting, 2×2 footprint rules, sell/repair, selection cards
- [x] Resources: Supplies + Fuel, per-minute generation, storage caps (CC base + bunkers)
- [x] Build/upgrade timers with Engineering Bay speed-ups; CC level gates counts and
      structure levels (emplacements included — leveled stats flow into the siege)
- [x] USA building set v1: Command Center L1–3, Supply/Fuel Depots, Storage Bunker,
      Engineering Bay (Barracks & Motor Pool deferred to M4 where army production exists)
- [x] Save/load: versioned JSON in localStorage + export/import file, reset with confirm
- [x] Offline resource accrual on load (8h cap), build timers complete while away,
      "while you were gone" report
- [x] Siege entry: assaults hit your *actual* town — buildings are big demolishable
      obstacles, walls lost in battle stay lost, setup-bought guns join the town,
      destroyed structures come back wrecked (repair 30% of cumulative cost)
- [x] Assault ladder (pre-campaign): deterministic difficulty generator — 3 waves at L1,
      grenadiers at L2, armor + Type 99 from L3, scaling counts beyond; victory loot +
      defeat penalty (raiders take 15% of stores)
- [x] Ordnance stock: power charges bought with Fuel in town, consumed per cast in battle

Carried to M3: a proper battle-report/defense-log screen (current: overlay + banner).

## M3 — v0.1 "Landfall": defense campaign ✅ → **first shareable build**

- [x] 9 USA campaign missions with authored waves and a difficulty curve (DIG IN →
      LANDFALL), fought on the player's persistent base; NK infiltrators surface from
      in-map tunnel mouths at M6, a Russian T-72 detachment probes at M7
- [x] Radio-log briefings (BriefingScene, line-by-line reveal) + after-action battle
      report (debrief text, stats, bonus objective result, salvage, requisition notes).
      A mission-select MAP screen is deferred to M6 polish — flow is linear NEXT MISSION
- [x] Tutorialization through mission design: each mission headlines one threat and
      unlocks the answer to the next (no modal tutorial)
- [x] Unlock flow: buildings, emplacements, field defenses, powers, and CC tiers gated
      by mission progress; locked buttons name the mission that grants them; SKIRMISH
      ladder unlocks after M2 as the farming track
- [x] Difficulty options: Standard / Hard (+30% hostiles), committed at first run
- [x] First-run experience: alternate-history framing + content stance, difficulty pick;
      pause (HOLD [F]) in battles; bonus objectives (+50% reward)
- [x] Deploy story: GitHub Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — builds,
      tests, and publishes `dist/` on push to main once Pages is enabled for the repo

Carried to M4: mission-select map screen (M6), replaying cleared missions.

## M4 — v0.2: offense + the Front Line ✅

The other half of the game: the counterattack.

- [x] AI base generator: three layout templates (compound, star, corridor) + seeded
      mutation, tier-scaled towers/levels/loot, fully deterministic per (tier, variant)
- [x] Scouting flow (Supplies cost pre-M6 Intel): unscouted targets are fogged;
      scouting persists per target
- [x] Raid planner: three squads with entry sectors (8 around the map), doctrines
      (Assault / Hunt Defenses / Raze Economy — real unit-AI programs in the sim),
      fixed per-squad launch stagger. Power auto-trigger rules deferred to M6 —
      raids ship without commander powers for now
- [x] Hands-off auto-resolve through the sim; loot per destroyed structure (caches pay
      Supplies, dumps pay Fuel, the command post pays big); losses are permanent
- [x] Replay viewer: ×1–×8 + skip-to-end, no-input playback of the exact battle
      (the config IS the recording); last raid kept on the save
- [x] Front Line ladder v1: tiers advance every 3 command posts; every 2nd cleared
      post triggers a counterattack siege on YOUR base before the next raid
- [x] Offline probe raids: 3-hour cadence capped at 3, loss caps (≤10% held / 15%
      breached), 12h shield after a breach, defense log with watchable replays —
      structures are never wrecked offline, walls lost stay lost
- [x] Army management: Barracks + Motor Pool with 5-deep training queues (run while
      offline), five USA units (Ranger, Engineer, Javelin, Humvee, Abrams), manpower
      cap from facility levels

Carried to M5: raid commander powers with auto-trigger rules; mission-select map (M6);
replaying cleared missions.

## M5 — v0.3: China playable *(~2–3 sessions)*

- [ ] Faction content pipeline proven: China as pure data (buildings, emplacements, units,
      field defenses, powers, signature mechanic)
- [ ] China campaign arc "Eastern Tide"
- [ ] Faction select at new-game
- [ ] **Headless balance harness**: batch-run raids/sieges, win-rate + time-to-kill matrices,
      first real balance pass

## M6 — v0.4: depth & polish *(~2–3 sessions)*

- [ ] Intel as a resource + Radar Station; research tech tree
- [ ] Vector art pass: proper unit/building silhouettes, atlas pipeline, palette enforcement
- [ ] Audio: radio-chatter UI feedback, siege ambience, sparse score
- [ ] Replay polish, kill-cams for probe raids
- [ ] QoL: hotkeys, colorblind-safe faction accents, speed controls everywhere
- [ ] Balance pass 2 with harness

## M7 — v0.5+: expansion *(ongoing, one drop per release)*

- [ ] Russia faction + "Iron Corridor" arc (Overbuilt mechanic, thermobarics)
- [ ] North Korea faction + "Silent Tunnels" arc (tunnel network bypassing mazes)
- [ ] UN Coalition faction + "Blue Line" arc (Mandate system, engineering)
- [ ] Air layer: air units + AA emplacements
- [ ] Offline defense doctrines (preset CP-spending AI for offline sieges)
- [ ] Share-code PvP-lite: export base as code, friends raid the snapshot
- [ ] Leagues, rotating events on the Front Line

---

## Working agreements

- The sim stays Phaser-free and deterministic; every feature lands with sim tests first.
- Balance numbers are provisional until M5's harness; resist hand-tuning before it exists.
- Each milestone is pushed to the repo in a runnable state with green tests.
